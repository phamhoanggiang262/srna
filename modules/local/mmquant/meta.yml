      	mmquant counts the number of reads (produced by RNA-Seq) per gene, much like HTSeq-count and featureCounts. The main difference with other tools is that multi-mapping reads are 
      	counted differently: if a read is mapped to gene A, gene B, and gene C, the tool will create a new feature, "geneA--geneB--geneC", that will be counted once.

     	A report provides stats on hits; one sequence may have zero, one, or several hits. An ambiguous hit is a hit that overlaps several annotation features. A non-uniquely mapped 
        hit belongs to a sequence that maps several loci in the genome.
